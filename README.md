## Project Overview
This project utilizes the kidney disease dataset available in the UCI Machine Learning Repository to train and test various classification models for predicting chronic kidney disease. The dataset contains 24 features, including demographic information, clinical measurements, and disease history of patients. The target variable is a binary classification indicating the presence or absence of chronic kidney disease.

## Prerequisites
The following Python libraries are required for this project:
- tkinter
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn
- keras
- tensorflow

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following main components:
1. Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning, feature selection, and normalization are performed to prepare the dataset for training.
2. Model Training: Various classification models, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks, are trained and compared.
3. Model Evaluation: The performance of the trained models is evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
4. Model Deployment: The best-performing model is deployed as a web application using tkinter for user interaction.

## Installation
To run this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it.
3. Install the required Python libraries using pip.
4. Run the main.py script to start the application.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chronic-kidney-disease-prediction.git
```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment
Create a virtual environment and activate it using the following commands:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Python Libraries
Install the required Python libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Run the Application
Run the main.py script to start the application:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Usage
Upon starting the application, you will be presented with a user interface that allows you to choose between training the project and testing the project.

- **Train Project:** This option will train the machine learning models using the provided dataset. The trained model will be saved to disk for later use.
- **Test Project:** This option will allow you to test the performance of the trained model using a new dataset. The predicted results will be displayed on the screen.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to predict chronic kidney disease using various classification models. By comparing the performance of different models, this project provides a baseline for further exploration and improvement.
